            <h2 class="baby-blue-text"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
            <p class="baby-blue-text"><strong>My name is John, and I am considered a non-traditional college student. For over a decade, I have gained experience in the human resources (HR) field within a corporate setting at the number one nonprofit organization in the state, where I hold a senior-level position. For years, a calling to design a ‘one of one’ HR software has echoed in my thoughts, which led me to resume my academic journey after a sixteen-year gap following my high school graduation. This calling became clear after realizing that success is not solely measured by financial gain but by the purpose of my actions. After graduating, I plan to transfer to a university to pursue a bachelor’s degree in computer science with a minor in human resources. I am considering relocating to the West Coast, which inspired me to learn more about one of the most beautiful cities, San Diego, California.</strong></p>

            <h2 class="baby-blue-text"><strong>Why San Diego?</strong></h2>
            <p class="baby-blue-text"><strong>San Diego is not only a beautiful place to visit but also an ideal city to live in. My goal is to share what makes San Diego special with its 1.3 million residents. One day, if I were to call myself a 'San Diegan,' I would wake up every day to a blue sky and enjoy endless options for sightseeing, museums, conventions, and beaches along 70 miles of coastline. The city’s close proximity to the Tijuana, Mexico border offers abundant authentic Mexican cuisine, as well as activities such as jet skiing, boat tours, and downtown life. Blue whale watching can be enjoyed at nearby beaches, along with snorkeling, scuba diving, kayaking, surfing, and paddleboarding. On land, there are opportunities for bird watching, golf, yoga by the ocean, biking, and hiking with sunset/sunrise ocean panoramic views.</strong></p>

            <p class="white-text"><strong>Visitors can enjoy thrilling activities like a 375-foot water slide, aircraft carrier tours, and day trips to Disneyland. As a queer person and ally of the LGBTQIA+ community, I appreciate that San Diego is known for its welcoming atmosphere toward LGBTQIA+ individuals, with neighborhoods such as Hillcrest and North Park serving as safe spaces for LGBTQIA+ events, nightlife, and culture. San Diego has perfect weather year-round, with mild temperatures and sunshine, making it an attractive destination for those seeking the best of Southern California’s lifestyle.</strong></p>

            <h2 class="white-text"><strong>San Diego: A Perfect Destination</strong></h2>
            <p class="white-text"><strong>San Diego is renowned for its beaches, parks, and warm climate. Its main attractions include Balboa Park, the renowned San Diego Zoo, museums, gardens, and Spanish Colonial-style architecture. A deep harbor is home to a large active naval fleet, with the USS Midway, an aircraft-carrier-turned-museum, open to the public. The city's vibrant culture and diverse communities make it an exciting place to explore and live.</strong></p>
